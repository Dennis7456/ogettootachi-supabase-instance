# üìß How to Access Invitation Emails

Your invitation system has multiple ways to view the emails that are sent. Here's how to access them
based on your environment:

## üè† **Local Development (Recommended for Testing)**

### **Method 1: Inbucket (Email Testing Tool)**

Your local Supabase setup includes Inbucket for capturing emails:

```bash
# Access Inbucket Web Interface
http://127.0.0.1:54324
```

**What you'll see:**

- ‚úÖ All invitation emails sent to any address
- ‚úÖ Full email content with styling
- ‚úÖ Email headers and metadata
- ‚úÖ Real-time email capture

### **Method 2: Supabase Studio Email Logs**

```bash
# Access Supabase Studio
http://127.0.0.1:54323

# Go to: Authentication > Logs
# Filter by: Email events
```

## üåç **Production Environment**

### **Method 3: Resend Dashboard (If Configured)**

If you've set up Resend API:

```bash
# Go to Resend Dashboard
https://resend.com/emails

# View all sent emails with delivery status
```

### **Method 4: Supabase Dashboard**

```bash
# Go to your Supabase Dashboard
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID

## ‚ö° **Quick Access Guide**

### **For Testing (Right Now):**

1. **Start Supabase locally:**

   ```bash
   cd ogettootachi-supabase-instance
   supabase start
   ```

2. **Send a test invitation** using your React component at:

   ```
   http://localhost:5173/test-invitation
   ```

3. **View the email immediately:**
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:54324
   ```

### **For Production:**

1. **Configure environment variables** with real email service
2. **Check Resend dashboard** or your email service logs
3. **Monitor Supabase logs** for delivery status

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting Email Access**

### **"No emails showing up"**

```bash
# Check if Supabase is running
supabase status

# Check Inbucket is accessible
curl http://127.0.0.1:54324

# Check invitation was created
# Look for console logs in your browser developer tools
```

### **"Emails going to spam"**

- **Local Development**: Emails are captured by Inbucket, not sent to real inboxes
- **Production**: Configure SPF/DKIM records for your domain

### **"Can't access Inbucket"**

```bash
# Restart Supabase services
supabase stop
supabase start

# Or access directly:
docker ps | grep inbucket
```
