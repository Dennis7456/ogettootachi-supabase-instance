-- Fix appointments RLS policies to avoid accessing auth.users table
-- The issue is that auth.users table has RLS enabled and regular users can't access it

-- Drop existing policies that try to access auth.users

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow users to update their own appointments" ON public.appointments;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Staff can update their appointments" ON public.appointments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own appointments" ON public.appointments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to create appointments" ON public.appointments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow service role full access to appointments" ON public.appointments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow staff to read all appointments" ON public.appointments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow staff to update any appointment" ON public.appointments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow staff to assign appointments" ON public.appointments;

-- Allow anyone to insert appointments (for public booking form)
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can insert appointments"

-- Allow authenticated users to select appointments
-- For now, allow all authenticated users to see all appointments
